        The Latvian Song and Dance Festival is one of the largest choral events in the world. 
        It is a celebration of Latvian folklore heritage with the underlying goal – to unite the nation and strengthen national identity. 
        The Festival, held every 5 years, brings together tens of thousands of participants from all over Latvia and worldwide. 
        This global gathering of Latvians and unique cultural expression of the Baltics is included in the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

        One of the highlights of the Festival is the procession - a day-long event held on the streets of Rīga with all Festival participants taking part, cheered on by locals, tourists and celebration spectators from all over the world. 
        The other two main events are the Dance Celebration final concert, held in Daugava Stadium and the Song Celebration grand finale – the final mass choir concert, held on the Mežaparks Open-air Stage on the outskirts of Rīga.
        Approximately 40 000 performers altogether participated in the event in its latest edition in 2023.

            <li> Origins and independent Latvia era (1873-1940)</li>
            <li> Soviet occupation era (1945-1991)</li>

        The mass singing tradition began in the 19th century in Western Europe, and while the tradition disappeared in other countries, in the Baltic States the tradition developed and flourished. 
        The origins of the choral tradition in Latvia stem back to the founding of local singing societies and church choirs in the countryside. 
        Folksongs – the core of the local singing tradition – were enhanced by the first Latvian composers who arranged them as songs for choirs, and these became part of the repertoire. 
        This also coincided with the period of the First National Awakening and the rise of Latvian national identity, culminating in the first Latvian Song Festival, held in Rīga in 1873.
